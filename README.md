# Pyanimalconverter Package

Badge goes here

## Description
Our package, pyanimalconverter, helps you to fullfill all of your unit conversion needs in convenient and enjoyable ways. You can simply get the conversions, compare two quantities in different units, or even find the minimum or maximum of a list. In addition, you can even choose to perform these conversions and comparisons in a conversation with some animal friends.

## Instructions for Importing

To import, please install the package with `pip install pyanimalconverter`. Then you can include `import pyanimalconverter` at the top of your code to use. From there can you call methods from `pyanimalconverter.convert`, `pyanimalconverter.conversation`, and `pyanimalconverter.minmax`. If you know you only want to use a certain function (like convert for example), you can use `import pyanimalcoverter.convert as convert`, then simply call `convert.convert()` with required parameters.
